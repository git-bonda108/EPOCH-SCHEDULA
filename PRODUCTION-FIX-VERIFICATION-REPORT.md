# ðŸŽ‰ PRODUCTION CALENDAR FIX - VERIFICATION REPORT

## Issue Resolution Summary
**SUCCESSFULLY FIXED**: July 6th, 2025 now correctly appears in the Sunday column on production

## Problem Identified
- **Issue**: July 6th, 2025 was incorrectly showing in Friday column instead of Sunday column
- **Root Cause**: Calendar component was not using proper week start calculation with `startOfWeek`/`endOfWeek`
- **Production URL**: https://epoch-schedula-v3-ejb41jdj5-satya-bondas-projects.vercel.app/

## Fix Applied
### Code Changes Made
**File**: `components/calendar-view.tsx`

**Before** (Incorrect):
```typescript
const calendarDays = eachDayOfInterval({ start: monthStart, end: monthEnd })
```

**After** (Fixed):
```typescript
// Get the start of the week for the first day of the month
// This ensures we have empty cells at the beginning if needed
const calendarStart = startOfWeek(monthStart, { weekStartsOn: 0 }) // Sunday = 0
const calendarEnd = endOfWeek(monthEnd, { weekStartsOn: 0 })

// Generate all days in the calendar grid (including empty cells)
const calendarDays = eachDayOfInterval({ start: calendarStart, end: calendarEnd })
```

### Technical Details
- Added proper imports: `startOfWeek, endOfWeek` from `date-fns`
- Set `weekStartsOn: 0` to ensure Sunday is the first day of the week
- Calendar now properly displays full weeks including leading/trailing days from adjacent months
